    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large boneless skinless chicken breasts
</li>
<li>Salt & pepper </li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
<li>Flour</li>
<li>1 tablespoon olive oil
</li>
<li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
<li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
<li>2 tablespoons lemon juice + zest of 1/2 lemon
</li>
</ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut your chicken breasts in half lengthwise so you have thinner cutlets. Sprinkle them with salt & pepper and the garlic powder. Dredge them in flour so they're nicely coated.
</li>
<li>Add the olive oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter to a skillet over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, add the chicken cutlets and cook them for 4-5 minutes/side or until they’re nice and golden. Take them out of the pan and set aside.</li>
<li>Add the chicken broth, lemon juice + zest, and remaining butter to the pan and let it bubble for a couple of minutes.
</li>   
<li>Add the chicken back in and cook for another few minutes until it's cooked through and the sauce is further reduced. Season with salt & pepper as needed and sprinkle the fresh parsley over top if using.
</li>
</ol>
