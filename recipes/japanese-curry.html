    <p>Katsu curry is just a variation of Japanese curry with a chicken cutlet 
     on top. I used a store-bought block of Japanese curry roux which is 
    commonly used in Japanese households. Chicken Cutlet (Japanese version of chicken 
        schnitzel) brings the Japanese curry up to the next level. It’s so delicious and
        filling.</p>
